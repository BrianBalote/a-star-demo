How to use:


The grid items are clickable.

Once clicked they will change and cycle through different colors.

Red - starting point

Green - end point

Black - wall

Blue - check point


Tapping on the Run A* button will generate a path between the starting point 
following through checkpoint(s) until it reaches the end point.

Tapping on the Reset button will reset the grid.
